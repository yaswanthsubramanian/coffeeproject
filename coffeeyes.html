            <p id="a2">Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans,
                primarily due
                to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared and
                presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffè latte, or already-brewed canned
                coffee).</p>

                    day with a cup.
                    (She loves it so much that she just launched The Pioneer Woman coffee line!) There are so many
                    popular
                    types of coffee to choose from, but for Ree, cold brew is the way to go. She mastered the art of
                    making
                    perfect cold-brewed iced coffee at home years ago, and these days she gets growlers of the stuff
                    from
                    her Pawhuska, OK, shop and restaurant The Mercantile, so she can have a tall glass every morning.
                    "To
                    say I couldn't live without it is an understatement," she says. Her obsession is on full display at
                    The
                    Merc's café, which serves a bunch of different types of coffee drinks: cold brew, of course, as well
                    as
                    espresso-based drinks like cortados, cappuccinos, macchiatos, and more.</p></strong>

                <p class="par1">Outside of Italy, cappuccino is a coffee drink that today is typically composed of a
                    single espresso shot and hot milk, with the surface topped with foamed milk. Cappuccinos are most
                    often prepared with an espresso machine</p>

                <p class="par1"> Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of Italian origin,[1] in which a small amount of nearly
                    boiling water  is forced under 9–10 bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi) of
                    pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.</p>
